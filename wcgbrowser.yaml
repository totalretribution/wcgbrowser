# The "whitelist" is a list of domains or hosts which will be matched against any requested url.
# If the hostname or domain name doesn't match an item on the list, the user gets the "Cannot go there" message
# see the readme file for more details on the whitelist's behavior
# The start_url host and bookmark hosts are automatically added to the whitelist.
# To disable whitelist filtering, just comment out whitelist, leave it empty, or specify use "False" as the value.
# To just whitelist the start_url host and bookmark url host(s), just put "True".
# Otherwise, specify a list of domains or hostnames to be added to the whitelist.

# If your browser has to navigate to a password-protected site (e.g., htaccess), you can set a default

# Proxy settings
# You can configure an HTTP proxy and port for the application to use; the format is <host>:<port>

# Set to 0 to disable this feature
# Default: 0

# Default: False

fullscreen: False

# "window_size" sets the default size of the application window
# It can be a <width>x<height> value, like "800x600"

# it is ignored if "fullscreen" is set (either in the config or commandline)
# default: None

# Set "navigation" to false to hide the top navigation bar.  Note that this makes bookmarks basically useless, since they won't appear.
# Default: True

#navigation: True

# "navigation_layout" is a list which sets the order and presence of buttons on the navbar from left to right.
# Valid values include "back", "forward", "refresh", "stop", "zoom_in", "zoom_out", "bookmarks", "print",  and "quit".
# "separator" will also add a separator line, and "spacer" will add an expanding spacer.
# Note that "print" will only show up if printing is enabled (allow_print), and "bookmarks" will only show up
# if bookmarks are defined.
# The default layout is ["back", "forward", "refresh", "stop", "zoom_in", "zoom_out", "separator", "bookmarks", "separator", "spacer", "quit"]
# Here's an alternative layout:

#navigation_layout: ["back", "forward", "refresh", "spacer", "bookmarks", "spacer", "quit"]


# "icon_theme" probably only works on Linux, but set it to an installed theme to set the icons for back/forward/reload/quit.
# The default is whatever your qt4 is set to use.

icon_theme:  "oxygen"


# "stylesheet" will assign a QT stylesheet to the application.  See examples for some style sheets.
# The default is empty, which will use the default system theme

#stylesheet: "examples/style.css"

# "quit_button_text" changes the text on the quit/reset button at the upper right
# default is "I'm Finished"

#quit_button_text: "Quit"

# "quit_button_mode" can be either 'close' or 'reset'
# 'close' will cause the button to exit the program
# 'reset' will simply clear the browser history and return to the main page.
# default behavior is 'reset'

#quit_button_mode: 'close'

# "page_unavailable_html" is the path to a *file* that contains html to be displayed whenever a page cannot be accessed,
# either because it's not available, or blocked due to security rules (whitelist, e.g.).
# The file should be on the local system, and only reference local resources (css, scripts, etc).
# It doesn't have to be a full page, or even HTML if you just want a simple text message.
# Leave it commented to use the default text built into the browser.
# Default: empty

#page_unavailable_html: "examples/custom404.html"

# "network_down_html" is the path to a *file* that contains html to be displayed whenever the start_url's host cannot be reached,
# which is very likely indicative of a network connectivity problem (rather than, say, a security restriction)
# The file should be on the local system, and only reference local resources (css, scripts, etc).
# It doesn't have to be a full page, or even HTML if you just want a simple text message.
# Leave it commented to use the default text built into the browser.
# Default: empty

#network_down_html: "examples/custom_network_down.html"

# Printing can be enabled by setting "allow_printing" to "True"
# When enabled, "print" will appear in the page's context menu.
# If "print" is included in the navigation layout, it will put a print button
# on the navigation bar too.
# Default: False

#allow_printing: True

# privacy_mode Configures whether or not "Private Browsing" mode is enabled on the webkit widget.
# Default: True

#privacy_mode: False

# Bookmarks are set in this structure.  They will appear as buttons on the top navigation bar.
# Each bookmark entry takes this form (note the indentation):
#
# key:
#   name: "&Button Label"
#   url: "http://www.example.com"
#   description: "A description of the website which will appear in the tooltip"
#
# Where "key" can be whatever you want -- most simply, a number.  The bookmarks will be sorted by key before
# being displayed, so this allows you to control the order in which they appear.
#
# There is also an older, simpler syntax that just uses the key as the name.  The downside
# is that you have no control over the order of the buttons.
#
# "&Button Label":
#    url: "http://www.example.com"
#    description: "A description of the website which will appear in the tooltip"
#
# The ampersand is optional, but if present the character following it will be the keyboard accelerator
# (e.g., in the example alt-B would activate the bookmark)
# Default: empty

    name: "Catalog &Home"

# External Content

#allow_external_content: True

# If you're allowing external content, then you need to specify what to do with a given MIME type.
# Otherwise, the user will get an error indicating the browser doesn't know what to do with it.
